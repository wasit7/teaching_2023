**Lecture Note:**

**Slide 1: Introduction to Data Engineering**

Welcome to the first week of our course on Data Processing and Exploration for Data Engineers! In this module, we will lay the foundation for understanding the critical role of data engineering in today's data-driven landscape. Let's begin.

**Slide 2: Significance of Data Engineering**

Data engineering is the backbone of data processing and analysis. It involves the collection, transformation, and delivery of data for various analytical purposes. Data engineers play a crucial role in shaping raw data into valuable insights that drive decision-making processes across industries.

**Slide 3: Applications of Data Engineering**

Data engineering finds applications in diverse industries. In finance, it helps process massive amounts of transactions. In healthcare, it ensures the secure management of patient records. Retail relies on data engineering to power recommendation systems, and so on. It's the unseen force that powers the data-driven world around us.

**Slide 4: Introduction to Functional Programming**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes modularity, abstraction, and immutability, making it ideal for building robust and scalable data processing pipelines.

**Slide 5: Modularity and Abstraction in Functional Programming**

Modularity, or breaking down a complex problem into smaller, reusable components, is a hallmark of functional programming. Abstraction allows us to hide complex implementation details and focus on the high-level logic of our programs. Both concepts contribute to writing clean and maintainable code.

**Slide 6: Example: Using Pandas for Data Processing**

Now, let's dive into a practical example of how functional programming principles can be applied using Python's pandas library. Consider a scenario where we have a dataset of customer orders. Using functional programming, we can write modular functions to filter, transform, and aggregate data.

**Code Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'customer_id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2],
    'order_amount': [100, 150, 200, 120, 180]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Filter orders above $150
filtered_orders = df[df['order_amount'] > 150]

# Calculate total order amount per customer
total_per_customer = filtered_orders.groupby('customer_id')['order_amount'].sum()

print(total_per_customer)
```

**Slide 7: Monads in Functional Programming**

Monads are a powerful design pattern in functional programming that help manage side effects and abstract complex operations. An example of a monad is the `Maybe` monad, which elegantly handles the presence of missing or null values in data processing.

**Code Example:**

```python
class Maybe:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value
    
    def bind(self, func):
        if self._value is None:
            return Maybe(None)
        return func(self._value)

# Example usage
def divide_by_two(x):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return Maybe(x // 2)
    return Maybe(None)

result = Maybe(10).bind(divide_by_two)
print(result._value)  # Output: 5

result = Maybe(7).bind(divide_by_two)
print(result._value)  # Output: None
```

**Slide 8: Conclusion**

In this session, we've introduced the fundamental concepts of data engineering and its importance in the data-driven world. We've also explored the principles of functional programming, emphasizing modularity, abstraction, and the use of monads. As we move forward, we'll continue to build on these concepts to become proficient data engineers.

That concludes our first lecture. Next week, we'll dive into the exciting world of data exploration techniques. Thank you for your attention, and see you in the next class!
